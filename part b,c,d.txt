The arrangement can be seening as 4 layers where we have A-D, E-L, M-T, U-X, and we can regard it as a loop which repeats twice.
We can see it as from A to B and C to D two columns of 8 layers. 
The number 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 is obviously devisible by 8, so we will eventually end up in the layer we started in.
So we will end up in M-T to U-X layer.
